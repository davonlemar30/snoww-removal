Snow Removal!!!!!! 🌨️❄️🚜
Welcome to Snow Removal 1.5 – the game where winter never ends, and your shoveling skills are the only thing standing between civilization and a new ice age. Developed with a mix of dread for winter's chill and a love for pixelated adventures, this game promises to keep you on the edge of your snow boots!

What's New in 1.5? ❄️✨
Gone are the days of mundane snow clearing. With 1.5, we've introduced:

-Fancier Titles: Because if you're going to shovel snow, you might as well do it in style. Our game title now dazzles within the canvas, like the aurora borealis, but with more "Snow Removal."

-Button Upgrades: Our "Start Game" button has been beefed up – bigger, bolder, and ready for your click. It's practically begging for a press.

-Sleek Design: We've optimized the look and feel, ensuring everything from snowflakes to shovels feels part of this frosty world.

Gameplay Basics ❄️👾
Alexander is your character, armed with nothing but determination and an infinite supply of shovels. Your mission? Keep those snowflakes from burying his coworkers!! Use the arrow keys to dodge, weave, and shovel your way to victory.

Arrow Keys: Move Alexander left and right.
Spacebar: Launch shovels to clear snowflakes.

Superpowers ❄️💥
Yes, you read that right. Hit enough snowflakes, and you'll activate superpowers – because every snow shoveler's dream is to throw shovels faster and move like they're on a slippery ice rink.
