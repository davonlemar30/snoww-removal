# SnowRemoval 1.7

SnowRemoval is an engaging and dynamic game where players work to keep office buildings free from accumulating snow. As the snowflakes continuously fall, it's a race against time and the elements!

## New Features in 1.7

- **Win/Lose Conditions**: The game now includes definitive win and lose conditions based on the state of the office buildings. Keep the buildings clear of snow to stay in the game. Once all three buildings are covered, it's game over.
  
- **Countdown Timer**: A timer intensifies the gameplay. Survive for a minute without letting all three buildings be buried in snow to secure victory. If they're all covered before time's up, it's game over!

- **Enhanced Win Screen**: Celebrate your win with a redesigned win screen that brings style to your success.

- **Lose Screen**: Face defeat with dignity with the new lose screen, reminding you of the challenge that lies ahead.

- **Stylish Buttons**: The 'Start Game' and 'Play Again' buttons have received a fresh coat of style to match the frosty theme.
